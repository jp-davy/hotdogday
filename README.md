# Hot Dog Day - Laravel/VueJS App To Order Hot Dogs

Does your child's school have Hot Dog Days? Well, then this is the starter project for you.

Why did I build this? Because I was sick of filling out paper forms every month for my child's school. Many parents had asked the school if there was a way they could do it online, but the school does not have the time, nor the expertise. So, I thought maybe I could whip up something cool and fun without too much effort. And here it is.

## Getting Started

Go ahead and fork the repository. This is not a Laravel package, it is a complete project. Feel free to take the whole thing, bits and bobs, or any piece of it you'd like.

### Prerequisites

This is a Laravel 5.7.x project, with VueJS, using Bootstrap 4.x.

### Installing

Fork the project, and do your thing.

## Tests?

No, I didn't do that. This was a silly side project, so I didn't take the time. I know, I should've. But, oh well. Do you want to submit a PR with the test? That'd be cool!

## Built With

* [Laravel](https://laravel.com/) - The PHP framework used
* [VueJS](https://vuejs.org/) - JavaScript framework used
* [Bootstrap CSS](https://getbootstrap.com) - Used to generate RSS Feeds

## Packages Used

* [Laravel Permission](https://github.com/spatie/laravel-permission) - This package is installed, but isn't used currently. I had plans for a nice admin, but decided SequelPro would work just fine for now.
* [Ramsey/uuid](https://github.com/ramsey/uuid) - UUID package for PHP.
* [Bugsnag](https://www.bugsnag.com) - For error tracking.

## Contributing

Please! Submit a PR. But know that I have a full time job as well, so I may, or may not get to your message/PR for a bit.
